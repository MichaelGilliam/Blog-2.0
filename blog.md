# Week 1 8/23/21 - 8/27/21

If I told you this first week was a breeze, I would be lying.  My first day started on Monday, leaving early from my town, to drive 170 miles to Awesome INC, just to be late from traffic, and finding a reasonable place to park.  To say the least, It was not a great start to my path to becoming a Web Developer.  So day two rolls around, I'm up early, I'm ready to grind, and focus on my first steps to this program.  I start by attempting to complete the tasks I'm required to do, but due to some website issues, my progress was delayed.  So I wasn't able to start working mid week pretty much.  Day 3 rolls around, and this is the part where everything goes downhill, and currently still is if I'm being honest.  I'm getting blocked left and right, just from simple tasks to do something, or its just a bot issue. 

Day 5 is now a thing, I hit the ground running and start completing my tasks as normal on Github per usual, and I'm still getting blocked left and right.  Unfortunately some tasks can take me up to 1-2 minutes, or some 20-30 minutes while I get lost attempting to do it myself.  While all of this is going on, I ask myself "What exactly am I learning"  Its so easy to get discouraged when you think all you're doing is just completing the instructions and do what you're told to do.  Day 5 was hard for me, although I got stuck on 1 single tasks for hours, I unfortunately didn't get any help for nearly 5 hours.  When I did receive help, It took only 1 minute to finish the task, and all it was, was a simple " comment on a issue ".  

Day 5 is coming to an end, I still haven't started on my blog that I was suppose to be complete by the end of the day, so i had nothing to present on demo day.  This is my blog, this is what I'm doing right now.  I don't even know If I'm doing this correctly.  Hopefully one day I'll look back at this and laugh at how hard I was struggling, but now its a mystery where I'll end up.  I know I'm not the only one struggling, so I have to keep reminding myself, we're all in this together.  

Lets talk about things I've somewhat learned and done this week at Awesome INC week 1 of the program. 

# Github

Github was the main learning experience this week for week 1.  Github has been very challenging for me so far, wondering "will this ever end?".  
Although Github wasn't my favorite learning experience, it is quite useful the things you can do with Github
So, what are some things you can do with github? 

 - Edit code on Github.com 

 - Pasting images

 - Formatting Code

## Week 2 8/30/21 - 9/3/21

The second week of bootcamp was a little bit smoother than last week.  There was alot of time spent not only learning HTML, and CSS, but also **working** on HTML, and CSS.  Last week was so stressful, and overwhelming due to everything you go through at once wondering if you made the right choice.  Although its still not *easy* work, everything starts to come together eventually.  I have to learn that failing fast, and failing often will be no stranger in my time here at Awesome INC.  

Lets talk about what I've learned, and struggled with this week.

Again, week 2 as alot of reading, and I'll be honest, I can't recall *everything*, but at least I learned something. 


- HTML Basics: Learned about the HTML tags, and what they're used to do. 
- CSS Basics: Learned how CSS is involved in code, and how it works.
- MORE GRASSHOPPER: Went through the grasshopper course, but this time with HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript.
- Google Chrome Dev Tools: Watched video's and read about how dev tools are important, and how they can help you in situations. 
- Birdwatching Project: Edited a webpage to make it look correct, by adding some HTML tags and images. 

## Struggles: 
What I'm currently struggling with well, a short answer would be " with everything " of course.  Not only does everything seem difficult at this point, I'm really enjoying when I see instant progress when messing with HTML / CSS.  

I would say my biggest struggle would be either focusing on the task and not steering off on my computer and playing a video game instead of work at a task I'm struggling on, or having confidence when it comes to the git terminal, and pushing code to github without messing up. 

## Summarizing week 2 : 

We all learn and struggle in different ways, but I know I can do this.  I will give my best effort so I can prove myself, **THIS CAN BE DONE**.  

Just like some of my other classmates have said, I cannot wait to get in the actual classroom and learn onsite.  Learning remote is something I don't excel at, but I only have 2 more weeks to go!
