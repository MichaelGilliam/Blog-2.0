# Week 1 8/23/21 - 8/27/21

If I told you this first week was a breeze, I would be lying.  My first day started on Monday, leaving early from my town, to drive 170 miles to Awesome INC, just to be late from traffic, and finding a reasonable place to park.  To say the least, It was not a great start to my path to becoming a Web Developer.  So day two rolls around, I'm up early, I'm ready to grind, and focus on my first steps to this program.  I start by attempting to complete the tasks I'm required to do, but due to some website issues, my progress was delayed.  So I wasn't able to start working mid week pretty much.  Day 3 rolls around, and this is the part where everything goes downhill, and currently still is if I'm being honest.  I'm getting blocked left and right, just from simple tasks to do something, or its just a bot issue. 

Day 5 is now a thing, I hit the ground running and start completing my tasks as normal on Github per usual, and I'm still getting blocked left and right.  Unfortunately some tasks can take me up to 1-2 minutes, or some 20-30 minutes while I get lost attempting to do it myself.  While all of this is going on, I ask myself "What exactly am I learning"  Its so easy to get discouraged when you think all you're doing is just completing the instructions and do what you're told to do.  Day 5 was hard for me, although I got stuck on 1 single tasks for hours, I unfortunately didn't get any help for nearly 5 hours.  When I did receive help, It took only 1 minute to finish the task, and all it was, was a simple " comment on a issue ".  

Day 5 is coming to an end, I still haven't started on my blog that I was suppose to be complete by the end of the day, so i had nothing to present on demo day.  This is my blog, this is what I'm doing right now.  I don't even know If I'm doing this correctly.  Hopefully one day I'll look back at this and laugh at how hard I was struggling, but now its a mystery where I'll end up.  I know I'm not the only one struggling, so I have to keep reminding myself, we're all in this together.  

Lets talk about things I've somewhat learned and done this week at Awesome INC week 1 of the program. 

# Github

Github was the main learning experience this week for week 1.  Github has been very challenging for me so far, wondering "will this ever end?".  
Although Github wasn't my favorite learning experience, it is quite useful the things you can do with Github
So, what are some things you can do with github? 

 - Edit code on Github.com 

 - Pasting images

 - Formatting Code

## Week 2 8/30/21 - 9/3/21

The second week of bootcamp was a little bit smoother than last week.  There was alot of time spent not only learning HTML, and CSS, but also **working** on HTML, and CSS.  Last week was so stressful, and overwhelming due to everything you go through at once wondering if you made the right choice.  Although its still not *easy* work, everything starts to come together eventually.  I have to learn that failing fast, and failing often will be no stranger in my time here at Awesome INC.  

Lets talk about what I've learned, and struggled with this week.

Again, week 2 as alot of reading, and I'll be honest, I can't recall *everything*, but at least I learned something. 


- HTML Basics: Learned about the HTML tags, and what they're used to do. 
- CSS Basics: Learned how CSS is involved in code, and how it works.
- MORE GRASSHOPPER: Went through the grasshopper course, but this time with HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript.
- Google Chrome Dev Tools: Watched video's and read about how dev tools are important, and how they can help you in situations. 
- Birdwatching Project: Edited a webpage to make it look correct, by adding some HTML tags and images. 

## Struggles: 
What I'm currently struggling with well, a short answer would be " with everything " of course.  Not only does everything seem difficult at this point, I'm really enjoying when I see instant progress when messing with HTML / CSS.  

I would say my biggest struggle would be either focusing on the task and not steering off on my computer and playing a video game instead of work at a task I'm struggling on, or having confidence when it comes to the git terminal, and pushing code to github without messing up. 

## Summarizing week 2 : 

We all learn and struggle in different ways, but I know I can do this.  I will give my best effort so I can prove myself, **THIS CAN BE DONE**.  

Just like some of my other classmates have said, I cannot wait to get in the actual classroom and learn onsite.  Learning remote is something I don't excel at, but I only have 2 more weeks to go!

## Week 3 09/06/21 - 09/10/21

Third week was a tough.  Facing blockers with learning / reading JavaScript.  I underestimated grasshopper this week since the past few weeks it seemed I very straight forward and hand holding.
This week JavaScript taught me there is so much more than just simple arrays, functions, etc.  Seriously there is...
I didn't get to demo any projects on demo day, because I procrasinated with the work, and underestimated the work for this sprint.
Plus I'm preparing to move states to get ready to go into person, so very busy.

My thoughts on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript during week 3: 

- HTML is probably the easiest language out of all of them.
- CSS is the 2nd easiest, and looks more challenging than it sounds.
- JavaScript looks like the hardest, and most interactive.  
JavaScript is probably my favorite at the moment, that might change once I realize how much harder it is to type / use the language.

## Struggles:
- JavaScript functions, etc. 
- DEBUGGING CODE
- Forgetting strings need "" 
- MOTIVATION 

## Summarizing Week 3 

So excited to start week 4, and get closer and closer to in person.  Hoping its way different than being at home as far as learning experience. 
Wish me luck!

# Week 4 blog: 
 **O_______________________O**

 Yep. Thats it.  Not only is that my face for this week, but for the rest of the weeks.

 This week was definately the easiest, and the hardest. 

 On a personal level, I started this week catching up on last weeks work, and moving to Lexington to get ready for the in person process.  

 So much has happened this week, so lets talk about it.


Tuesday started with 2 hours of sleep, a packed uHaul, car trailer, and I head leave my hometown in TN for the 180 mile trip up my new home in Lexington.
Thanks to some AMAZING people in the Bootcamp Slack channel, I was able to get some help moving some of my stuff into my apartment, but there is a twist.  While unloading my stuff in the back, some woman hit my uHaul and DELAYED my entire progress for learning this week, and moving.  

Wednesday comes around, I'm able to FINALLY get settled in, and get internet in my new place.... lets get to work.  Wednesday started off with ALOT of reading (From what I can remember), 
So much reading... so much, that I don't even remember most of what I read... (oops).  Then came the Kata's on Codewars.... Oh man.... O___O

So lets just say, I had to do a lot of googling to get some refresh on the brain, on stuff that is very basic level.  I HAD TO GOOGLE WHAT A INTEGER IS, A **INTEGER**.  

The first 2 Kata's were pretty hard for me,  the 3rd one was okay, and the 4th one was a on and off challenge.  I really enjoyed the last Kata we had to do, because well for one, I had almost passed my first attempt on my code.  I added a new line of code, passed, but didn't pass all the tests, just one.  So I was stumped for awhile, but I knew I had it, I was SO close.  

Chad, one of my good friends that I've gotten to known well guided me through it, and we we're able to get it done.  

**Project of the week**: Bouncing balls project, I thought it was going to be so intimidating, I didn't get to start on the project until Sunday, and 2 days overdue.  

Turns out the copy / paste code the project was given to us, basically completes the project as a whole, and we need to do some stretch goals to make it "look cool", and function better.

So honestly I just left it alone, didn't challenge myself, because I start in person class in currently.... 6 hours... welcome to my life lol. 

### What was helpful during Onboarding working remotely?
- The most used answer is probably the Slack channel, but honestly its the instructors.  Although with all the rollercoaster emotions you have, doubting yourself, wondering if you made the right choice, etc.  Although we never had a professional or personal relationship with Ian or Justin, they both went out of their way to make sure everything went as smooth as it can.  They're not only very nice, but also very understanding.  So if you're reading this, thanks!

### What hindered your progress during Onboarding?
- It has to be alot of things that go into play with this question.  Mostly for me, I would honestly give up too easy, click off the task, and go play a game of something.  Doing work that I'm suppose to do, in the same place I play my video games is not a good mixture for getting work DONE.

### How did you overcome challenges during Onboarding?
- Several ways you can do this, look at the help channel in Slack, uninstall any programs that distract you while working (literally), talk about cool things that coding can do to motivate you to continue further, and finally, **CONSTANTLY REMINDING YOURSELF WHY YOU STARTED**.

# SUMMARIZING PRE WORK (FIRST 4 WEEKS):

**TO WHOM IT MIGHT CONCERN**: Even at the end of week 4, I still feel like I don't know anything at ALL.  I feel like some people are way smarter than me, and I undervalue myself deeply.  I hope in person has such a good vibe to it, and well, if this doesn't work out, at least I met some pretty cool people out here in Lexington.

HTML, CSS we spent not as much as I thought we would around (2 weeks), then jumped right into JavaScript, and I was drowning.  JavaScript has been crazy so far, and we still have 4 more weeks of that with react and bootstrap.  I was so uncomfortable and scared to get used to the terminal to make repo's and commit changes to our github projects.  It took me around mid week 3 to get somewhat okay with the terminal, and git.  Watching Ian's tutorials over and over on how to make a blog and upload it to github, and using that to make my other projects **HELPED SO MUCH**.  Hopefully one day this is all worth it, and I look back at the working im doing, like this, and laugh at how easy everything would be.  Gotta be up in 4 1/2 hours to get ready for week 5, SO LETS PUSH THIS BLOG UP TO GITHUB AND GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO.
